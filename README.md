As the [Java Conflation Suite](http://www.vividsolutions.com/jcs/) seems to be abandoned (I mailed various members and on the mailing list) and I couldn't find access to a source repository, I took the liberty of download the available source drops (`1.0.0` and `1.0.1`) and pushing them to this repository.
